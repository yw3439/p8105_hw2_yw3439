## Problem 1. Tidy Mr.Â Trash Wheel

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1,
                   cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))
  )
```

## Tidy Precipitation Data

``` r
precip_2017 = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(
    year =rep("2017", 12),
    month = factor(month, labels = month.name)
  )

precip_2018 = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(
    year =rep("2018", 12),
    month = factor(month, labels = month.name)
  )

precip = full_join(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.character(month)
  ) %>%
  rename("precipitation_inch" = "total")
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "total", "year")

``` r
balls_2017 = trash_wheel %>%
  filter(year == "2017") %>%
  select(sports_balls)
```

Mr.Trash Wheel dataset mainly discusses about the content within every
dumpster recorded from 2014 to 2019, a total of 344 records of dumpster.
The dataset focuses on measurements on certain variables, weight\_tons,
volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette\_butts,
glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags, sports\_balls,
homes\_powered. Among these types of trashes, the most one is
cigarette\_butts showing the mean of 3.075412810^{4}. The least one is
homes\_powered with the mean of 11.8110465.

Two precipitation datasets record precipitation data for each month in
2017 and 2018, shown as below.

| month     | precipitation\_inch | year |
| :-------- | ------------------: | :--- |
| January   |                2.34 | 2017 |
| February  |                1.46 | 2017 |
| March     |                3.57 | 2017 |
| April     |                3.99 | 2017 |
| May       |                5.64 | 2017 |
| June      |                1.40 | 2017 |
| July      |                7.09 | 2017 |
| August    |                4.44 | 2017 |
| September |                1.95 | 2017 |
| October   |                0.00 | 2017 |
| November  |                0.11 | 2017 |
| December  |                0.94 | 2017 |
| January   |                0.94 | 2018 |
| February  |                4.80 | 2018 |
| March     |                2.69 | 2018 |
| April     |                4.69 | 2018 |
| May       |                9.27 | 2018 |
| June      |                4.77 | 2018 |
| July      |               10.20 | 2018 |
| August    |                6.45 | 2018 |
| September |               10.47 | 2018 |
| October   |                2.12 | 2018 |
| November  |                7.82 | 2018 |
| December  |                6.11 | 2018 |

2018 showed the total of precipitation of 70.33. Combining observations
for both the trash wheel dataset and the precipitation dataset, as the
precipitation went up with increment of 3.86 from January to February,
amounts of dumped grocery bags, chip bags and sports balls also
increased significantly. Inferred trend about the positive correlation
between sports ball and precipitation can also be noticed in 2017. As
the amount of precipitation went continually down starting from July of
7.09 to December of 0.94, the amount of sports ball showed decreased
trend. The median number of sports ball in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.

## Problem.2 NYC Transit Data

``` r
subway = read_csv("NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, entry, vending, 
         entrance_type, ada, starts_with("route")) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry,"YES" = "TRUE"),
    entry = recode(entry, "NO" = "FALSE")
  )
```

The dataset NYC Transit Data mainly discusses about each subway stations
in NYC. Data about the accurate address of the station is shown in line,
station\_name, station\_latitude, station\_longitude. entry, vending,
entrance\_type, ada dispalys the entry information for that station. The
rest variables with prefix of route show different subway route services
that each station provides with. Generally, the dataset, after tidy,
contains 19 columns and 1868 rows, which is considered as not completely
tidied because there are too many missing values in variables with
prefix of routes. Further steps may need to make the whole dataset more
clean.

There are 356 stations in NYC.468 stations are ADA compliant. Among all
stations, the proportion of station entrances/exits without vending is
0.0979657.

``` r
reform_subway = subway %>%
  select(station_name, ada, starts_with("route")) %>%
  mutate(
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name"
  )

a_train = reform_subway %>%
  filter(route_name == "A") %>%
  distinct(station_name, ada)
```

There are 57 distinct stations serve the A train. Of these stations,
there are 16 ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

``` r
pols_month = read.csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  select(-day) %>%
  mutate(
    month = factor(month, labels = month.name),
    prez_gop = replace(prez_gop, prez_gop == 2, 1),
    prez_gop = ifelse(prez_gop == 0, "democratic", "republician")
  ) %>%
  select(-prez_dem) %>%
  rename("president" = "prez_gop")

snp = read.csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  select(year, month, -day, close) %>%
  mutate(
    month = factor(month, labels = month.name))

unemploy = read.csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    month = factor(month, levels = c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun",
                   "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec")),
    month = factor(month, labels = month.name),
    year = as.character(year))

pol_snp = full_join(pols_month, snp)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

``` r
fivethirtyeight = full_join(pol_snp, unemploy) %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year)
  )
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

The Fivethirtyeight dataset, containing 11 variables and 828
observations, mainly discusses about the status of unemployment and
financial market during the period of 1947, 2015, ranging from 1947 to
2015 under governing interchangeably by Republican and Democratic. The
dataset shows amounts of senates and representatives for two governments
for each year. Unemployment statistics is analyzed in terms of
percentage of unemployment in each month for every year.

Financial market status is shown with the closing values of the S\&P
stock index for each month within each year. There is no recorded
observations for stock index before 1950. The overall trend for closing
values of stock index is increasing from 17.049999 to NA, meaning that
economy in United States is developing with the pretty significant
enhancement. Unemployment percentage shows no big leap from 1947 to
2015, with a mean of 5.83 and a median of 5.83. The lowest unemployment
percentage is NA in 1948.
